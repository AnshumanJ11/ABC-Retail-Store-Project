# Project Overview

This project presents the financial records for ABC Retail Store’s first month of operations by following the essential accounting processes. The first step involved recording transactions in T-accounts with accurate debit and credit entries for key accounts such as Cash, Inventory, Accounts Payable, Sales, and Expenses. Once all the transactions were posted, the balances were transferred from T-accounts to a Trial Balance to ensure that total debits equaled total credits. 
The Income Statement was prepared by listing the revenues (cash and credit sales) and subtracting the expenses (rent, salaries, and utilities) to determine the net income/loss for the period. ABC store’s assets (cash, inventory, supplies, and accounts receivable), liabilities (accounts payable), and owner’s equity were presented in the balance sheet to ascertain the business's financial position at the end of the month. This project highlights application of core accounting concepts and the creation of financial statements with precision using Excel.
