# Project Overview

This project presents the financial records for ABC Retail Store’s first month of operations by following essential accounting processes. The first step involved recording transactions in T-accounts with accurate debit and credit entries for key accounts such as Cash, Inventory, Accounts Payable, Sales, and Expenses. Once all transactions were posted, the balances from the T-accounts into a Trial Balance to ensure that total debits equaled total credits. Using the trial balance, I prepared the Income Statement by listing revenues (cash and credit sales) and subtracting expenses (rent, salaries, and utilities) to determine the net income for the period. Lastly, I created the Balance Sheet, organizing the store’s assets (cash, inventory, supplies, and accounts receivable), liabilities (accounts payable), and owner’s equity to present the business's financial position at the end of the month. This project highlights my ability to apply core accounting concepts and create financial statements with precision using Excel.
